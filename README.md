## Introduction

The PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization project offers an interactive web application to visualize various data insights related to digital transactions and user behavior on the PhonePe platform. It leverages Streamlit for the web application framework, Plotly for interactive visualizations, MySQL for data storage, and Pandas for data manipulation.

## Features

- Visualize aggregated transaction data by state, year, and quarter.
- Analyze user behavior patterns based on transaction counts, brands, and percentages.
- Explore mapped transaction and user data by state and district.
- Identify top transactions and users based on transaction counts and registered users.
- Interactive pie charts, bar charts, and choropleth maps for data visualization.
- Filter data by quarter for deeper analysis.

## Document Information Extractor
The Document Information Extractor is a Python-based project aimed at extracting structured data from various document formats, including PDFs, Word documents, and plain text files. This tool is particularly useful for automating the extraction of specific data points or metadata from documents, streamlining the process of information retrieval and analysis.

## Features
Multi-format Support: Extract information from PDFs, Word documents, and plain text files.
Customizable Extraction: Define rules and patterns to extract specific data points or metadata from documents.
Structured Output: Output extracted information in a structured format, such as JSON or CSV, for further analysis and processing.
Scalability: Process large collections of documents efficiently, thanks to optimized extraction algorithms.
Ease of Use: Simple command-line interface for initiating document extraction with minimal configuration.

# Airbnb Data Visualization Dashboard

This project is a Streamlit application for visualizing Airbnb listings data. The dashboard provides various insights such as basic statistics, distribution of property types, average prices, room type distributions, and more. It also includes geospatial visualizations if the dataset contains latitude and longitude information.

## Features

- **Basic Statistics**: Summary statistics of the dataset.
- **Distribution of Property Types**: Bar chart showing the count of different property types.
- **Average Price per Property Type**: Bar chart showing the average price for each property type.
- **Room Type Distribution**: Pie chart showing the distribution of different room types.
- **Number of Reviews Distribution**: Histogram showing the distribution of the number of reviews.
- **Review Score Rating Distribution**: Histogram showing the distribution of review scores.
- **Availability in the Next 30 Days**: Histogram showing the availability of listings in the next 30 days.
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Map and detailed visualization of listings (if latitude and longitude columns are present).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airbnb-visualization.git
    cd airbnb-visualization
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the MySQL database**:
    - Ensure you have MySQL installed and running.
    - Create a database named `myproject`.
    - Import your Airbnb dataset into a table named `airabnb`.

5. **Configure the database connection**:
    - Update the database connection parameters in `app.py` (host, user, password, database) to match your MySQL setup.

## Industrial Copper Modelling
Selling Price and Status Prediction
This project includes a machine learning solution for predicting the selling price and status (won/lost) of items. It uses linear regression for predicting the selling price and logistic regression for predicting the status. The models are trained on a dataset and then deployed using a Streamlit app for interactive predictions.

# Dataset
The dataset Copperdata.xlsx includes various features such as:

Quantity (tons)
Customer ID
Country Code
Item Type
Application Code
Thickness
Width
Material Reference
Product Reference
Item Date
Delivery Date
Selling Price (target for regression)
Status (target for classification)
# Models
  The project includes two machine learning models:

  Linear Regression: For predicting the continuous variable selling_price.
  Logistic Regression: For predicting the categorical variable status (won/lost).
  Setup
  To set up the project, follow these steps:

# Clone the repository:

   bash
   Copy code
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/selling-price-status-prediction.git
  cd selling-price-status-prediction
  Install the required packages:

 # Copy code
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   Training the Models
   To train the models and save them along with the label encoders, run the training script:

# Copy code
    python train_models.py
# Copy code
    streamlit run app.py
The app will open in your default web browser. You can input the values for the features, and it will predict the selling price and status.
